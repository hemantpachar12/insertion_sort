# insertion_sort
Insertion Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array one item at a time. It is much less efficient on large lists than more advanced algorithms such as Quick Sort, but it has several advantages over them in some cases, including its simplicity and ease of implementation.

# Algorithm
The basic algorithm works as follows:

Assume the first element is already sorted.
For each subsequent element, compare it to the elements before it and insert it into the correct position in the sorted sublist.
Repeat step 2 for all elements in the list.
# Time Complexity
The worst-case time complexity of the insertion sort algorithm is O(n^2), where n is the number of elements in the list. This occurs when the list is in reverse order, and each element has to be compared with all the previous elements. The best-case time complexity is O(n), which occurs when the list is already sorted.

# Usage
Insertion Sort is an easy-to-implement algorithm that is useful for small or nearly-sorted lists. It is often used as an intermediate step in more advanced sorting algorithms, such as Shell Sort or Quick Sort. It can also be used in situations where the list is being built dynamically and needs to be sorted as each new element is added.
